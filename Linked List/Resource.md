Questions :

1. Create a Linked-list
2. Insert Node at Beginning/ Middle / end of the linked-list. [Hea, Tail, middle]
3. Traverse Linked-list
4. Delete Node from Beginning / Middle / end of the linked-list. [Hea, Tail, middle]
   Delete Note at position using position or value.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
5. Reverse LL -> 1 approach -> current, prev and forward node.
6. Detect cycle in linked-list -> two Approaches
   1. Using HashMap -> visited nodes
   2. Using Floyd's Cycle detection algorithm [slow and fast pointers] == When two pointer meets then there is cycle else not.
7. Remove cycle from linked-list
8. Return Middle of Linked-list -> 1 Approach :
   1. Take total count of linked list, divide it by two. you'll get mid, how run new Linked-list till that mid and return head;
9. Check if Linked-list is circular or not i.e [a | 343] -> [b | 344] -> [c | 343] here c node contains the address of a node. so there is cycle
10. Return start of the cycle -> floyd's cycle or hashmap can solve this problem.
11. Remove Duplicates from Sorted Linked-list. -> two approaches:
    1. Using two pointer approach.
    2. Using hashmap
12. Remove Duplicates from UnSorted Linked-list. -> 3 Approaches:
    1. Using Hashmap
    2. By sorting the Linked-list
    3. Using Brute-force (Two while loop)
